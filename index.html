<p>I hold a PhD from the School of Computing and Information Systems at the University of Melbourne. The <i>Melbourne Research Scholarship</i> fully funded my PhD. My thesis focused on designing advanced computational methods, with key disciplines including Natural Language Processing, Pattern Recognition, Deep Learning, and Information Systems for sustainable systems and the public good.
   
<br><br> I completed my Master of Technology (2017‚Äì2019) at JNU, New Delhi, and was also associated with the Special Centre for Disaster Research, JNU, as a Project Associate (2018‚Äì2019).
