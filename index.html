<p>My name is Rabindra Lamsal. I'm a Ph.D. Candidate (2021-24) at the School of Computing and Information Systems, University of Melbourne. I am supported by the Melbourne Research Scholarship for my Ph.D. research. My thesis focuses on designing advanced computational approaches for effective processing of crisis-related social media texts.
   
<br><br> I did my M.Tech. (2017-19) from JNU, New Delhi, and I was also associated with the Special Centre for Disaster Research, JNU, as a Project associate (2018-19). My areas of research interest are Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, Sentence Representations, and Large-Scale Data Mining.
