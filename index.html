<p>My name is Rabindra Lamsal. I hold a PhD from the School of Computing and Information Systems at the University of Melbourne. My PhD research was fully funded by the Melbourne Research Scholarship. My thesis focused on designing advanced computational methods, with key disciplines including Natural Language Processing, Pattern Recognition, Deep Learning, and Information Systems for sustainable systems and the public good.
   
<br><br> I completed my Master of Technology (2017â€“2019) at JNU, New Delhi, and was also associated with the Special Centre for Disaster Research, JNU, as a Project Associate (2018â€“2019). My research interests include Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, Sentence Representations, and Large-Scale Data Mining.
