<h2>Projects</h2>
<ul>
	
<li>
		<b>Live Twitter Sentiment [<a href="https://sentiment.live">web application</a>]</b><br>
		A near-real-time sentiment analysis project. Two datasets, which were the products of this project, have been selected as the first-place winner in the Spring 2020 IEEE DataPort Dataset Competition. <br>

<li> <b>Word Embeddings (Word2Vec Implementation) for Nepali Language [<a href="https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/300-dimensional-word-embeddings-nepali-language">IEEE Dataport</a>]</b><br>
Word2Vec implementation of a Nepali language corpora having 90 million running words. The
text corpora was designed by scrapping publicly available news content of various Nepali online
news portals. The model has Word Embeddings for 0.5 million Nepali words.</li><br>



<li> <b>Indian Premier League (IPL) Matches Prediction Model</b><br>
A machine learning model capable of predicting the outcome of an IPL match, 15 minutes before
the gameplay, immediately after the toss results. The prediction model was able to correctly predict
43 out of 60 matches of 2018 season. Project carried out as a part of the course <em>Artificial Intelligence</em>.
